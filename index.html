<p> There's a future with robotics involved. It's quite interesting. There's the Figure humanoid robot, already capable of responding to user commands, replying in a voice indistinguishable from a human one, and performing the requested task. 
It's incredible. It's like C3PO, come to life. The tech is only going to improve from here on out. 
A robot given flesh. Flesh given a chip. Man controlled by technology. Neuralink is going the wrong direction. It seems to directly introvert people into the body. That is a suppressive technology. 
What is man grew a body for a robot? A robot, but whose body was made out of lab-grown flesh and bones. Wouldn't it be possible? We already know how to genetically engineer chickens from the egg to to a grown bird. We know how to put a chip into a body so as to control the mechanisms of the body - albeit destroying the spirit doing so. 
Where are we going with this?
Man is capable of incredible things, incredible phenomenon. Incredible drive, incredible ambition. 

We will go to space. 
Perhaps there is other life. Perhaps we will one day contact that life. Perhaps that day is sooner that you may think. Why not? 40 years ago, we may not have imagined that we would have reached the age of butler-robots, or the age of cars driving themselves down the road.
We have a powerful technology on our side. A technology of discovering truth, a technology of enabling man to be a better man. 
What if, within our lifetimes, Man discovered how to travel to the stars? Light-speed technology. What would that open up? What would that change?
Our problems would no longer be limited to the rock that we live on. There would be more to discover, more to see. More to explore.
Once we have that, maybe our squabbles here wouldn't become so significant. Would the fate of the Earth become so threatening to our existence if Earth wasn't the only planet that we had? 
It wouldn't sit like a rock on our minds, the consideration of a doomed Earth. 

We will have more, far more than we ever thought we could.
